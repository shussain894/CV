## Shah Hussain

I am a Makers trained Junior Software and DevOps Engineer with AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solution Architect qualifications. I have strong interpersonal skills and am constantly improving my technical skills with side projects in various tech stacks.

I was training to be a chartered accountant when I realised I did not enjoy what I was doing, I joined a cloud computing bootcamp where I completed my AWS certifications and was studying Python, I was introduced to programming and was amazed by its endless possibilities, I knew I had gaps in my skillset and there I found Makers Academy, a 16 week full-stack web development bootcamp.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
